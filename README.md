# Data Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio!

I have a Master Degree in financial and banking law. I've also started a Data Analyst course with Openclassrooms in collaboration with ENSAE in January 2022 that I've finished it in November 2022 üë©‚Äçüéì

This course contained 9 projects (they all written in french and for the next ones, they will be written in english).
<br/> 1 - Perform sales analysis for an e-commerce (60 hours)
<br/> 2 - Create and use a real estate database with SQL (70 hours)
<br/> 3 - Conduct a public health study with Python (90 hours)
<br/> 4 - Optimize store data management with Python (80h)
<br/> 5 - Analyze the sales of a bookstore with Python (100 hours)
<br/> 6 - Analyze gender equality indicators with Knime (100 hours)
<br/> 7 - Conduct a drinking water study with Tableau (100 hours)
<br/> 8 - Produce market research with Python (120 hours)
<br/> 9 - Detect fake banknotes with Python (140 hours)


In this portfolio, I have included (and I will continue to include) a variety of projects that showcase my data analytics skills. 
<br/> You will also find examples of dashboards and reports I have created. 
<br/> In addition, these different projects show my ability to analyze and present data in a clear and visually appealing way.

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è I will start learning R and Power BI in the next few months and acquire my knowledge by doing projects via KAGGLE or free databases
