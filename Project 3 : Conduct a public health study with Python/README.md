# Project 3 : Conduct a public health study 🗺️
## Language : Python 💻
## Project duration : 90H ⌛
#### You can find [my notebook](https://github.com/AMLaura/Data_Portfolio/blob/main/Project%203%20:%20Conduct%20a%20public%20health%20study%20with%20Python/P3_Notebook_Python.ipynb) and [the presentation](https://github.com/AMLaura/Data_Portfolio/blob/main/Project%203%20:%20Conduct%20a%20public%20health%20study%20with%20Python/P3_Presentation.pdf) I prepared (initially in PPT format)

### I- The main objective 🎯

Provide an overview of the state of malnutrition in the world, based on FAO database.


### II- Calculate

<br/> 1 - The proportion of people undernutrition
<br/> 2 - The theoretical number of people who could be fed
<br/> 3 - The theoretical number of people who could be fed (vegetable products)
<br/> 4 - The use of internal availability, in particular:
<br/> • The share allocated to animal feed
<br/> • The part that is lost
<br/> • The part that is actually used for human food
<br/> 5 - The countries for which the proportion of undernourished people is the highest in 2017
<br/> 6 - Countries that have received the most aid since 2013
<br/> 7 - Countries with the most/least availability/inhabitant
<br/> 8 - Use and distribution of cereals between human and animal food
<br/> 9 - Analyze the use of cassava in Thailand
<br/> 10 - Find the calculation of domestic food availability
