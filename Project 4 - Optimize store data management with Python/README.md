## Language : Python üíª
## Project duration : 80H ‚åõ
#### You can find [my notebook](https://github.com/AMLaura/Data_Portfolio/blob/main/Project%204%20-%20Optimize%20store%20data%20management%20with%20Python/P4_Notebook.ipynb) and [the presentation](https://github.com/AMLaura/Data_Portfolio/blob/main/Project%204%20-%20Optimize%20store%20data%20management%20with%20Python/P4_Presentation.pdf) I prepared (initially in PPT format)

### I- The main objective üéØ

<br/> A wine and spirits store wanted to optimize the management of its resources. 
<br/> Indeed, we have 3 databases which each contain essential data.
<br/> The main purpose is to perform a join to obtain a single database to facilitate analysis.


### II- Calculate

<br/> The store wishes, among other things, to know:
<br/> 1 - Total sales performance
<br/> 2 - Total sales performance by product
<br/> 3 - Atypical values and deciding if it is better to remove them or not
<br/> 4 - Analyze these atypical values
