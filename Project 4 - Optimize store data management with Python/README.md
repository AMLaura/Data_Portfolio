## Language : Python 💻
## Project duration : 80H ⌛
#### You can find my notebook and the presentation I prepared (initially in PPT format)

### I- The main objective 🎯

<br/> A wine and spirits store wanted to optimize the management of its resources. 
<br/> Indeed, we have 3 databases which each contain essential data.
<br/> The main purpose is to perform a join to obtain a single database to facilitate analysis.


### II- Calculate

<br/> The store wishes, among other things, to know:
<br/> 1- Total sales performance
<br/> 2- Total sales performance by product
<br/> 3- Atypical values and deciding if it is better to remove them or not
<br/> 4- Analyze these atypical values
