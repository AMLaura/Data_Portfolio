<br/> 6- List of the 10 most expensive apartments with the area and the number of square meters
<br/> 7- Rate of change in the number of sales between the first and second quarters of 2020
<br/> 8- The ranking of regions in relation to the price per square meter of apartments with more than 4 rooms
<br/> 9- List of municipalities having had at least 50 sales in the 1st quarter
<br/> 10- Percentage difference in price/square meter between a 2 room apartment and a 3 room apartment
<br/> 11- Average land values for the top 3 municipalities in departments 6, 13, 33, 59 and 69
