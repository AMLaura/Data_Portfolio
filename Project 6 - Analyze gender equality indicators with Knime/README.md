# Project 6 : Analyze gender equality indicators with Knime
## Software : KNIME üíª
## Project duration : 100H ‚åõ
#### You will find a screenshot of [my KNIME workflow](https://github.com/AMLaura/Data_Portfolio/blob/main/Project%206%20-%20Analyze%20gender%20equality%20indicators%20with%20Knime/Workflow_KNIME_Capture.jpeg)

### I- The main objective üéØ

Automate the creation of a diagnostic report on gender equality in the workplace by retrieving the databases.

Once the databases have been recovered. 
I analyzed professional gender equality by choosing several indicators that I selected after reading the documentation provided by the Ministry of Labour.

‚ö†Ô∏è Key point: the processing of data must be completely anonymized (compliance with the RGPD)

### II- Indicators

I finally chose more indicators in order to have a more global view.

So I compared between:
<br/> 1- Gender, satisfaction and the department in which the employee works
<br/> 2- The type, number of work accidents and the department in which the employee works
<br/> 3- Gender and hourly rate
<br/> 4- The gender, salary and department in which the employee works
<br/> 5- The type and number of increases
<br/> 6- Gender and service
<br/> 7- The type and number of promotions
<br/> 8- Service, gender and seniority
<br/> 9- The type and type of contract
<br/> 10- The gender, type of contract and number of working hours
<br/> 11- Top 10 hight salaries
