### I- The main objective üéØ

The purpose of this project is to identify countries in difficulty regarding access to drinking water by using different interactive views.

I have been asked for 3 views on the Tableau story (also known as "dashboards")
<br/> 1- A global view with an aggregation of indicators at the global level
<br/> 2- A continental view with aggregated indicators for the continent selected by the user
<br/> 3- A national view with the indicators for the country selected by the user.

The indicators to be used and allowing to answer this problem are the following:
<br/> 1- The mortality rate due to unsanitary water
<br/> 2- The population / population density (download a database with the area of the countries)
<br/> 3- Percentage of residents with access to drinking water
<br/> 4- The political stability of the country, the evolution of these factors over time
<br/> 5- The evolution of these factors over time.
<br/> 6- Countries requiring the creation of their drinking water access services
<br/> 7- Countries requiring modernization of their access to drinking water services


In addition, I also had to calculate the indicators at the national level for the following 3 areas of expertise:
##### 1- Area 1 (services creation): graph combining the rate of access to drinking water and the rate of urban population. 
<br/> Indeed, developing infrastructure when the population is concentrated in the city is not the same task as doing it with rural populations.

##### 2- Area 2 (services modernization): 
<br/> Need a graph that combines the rate of ‚Äúbasic‚Äù services (infrastructure) and the rate of quality infrastructure (qualified as ‚Äúsafely managed‚Äù in the data) in order to identify countries that have a strong need to improve the quality of their services

##### 3- Area 3 (consulting): 
<br/> Need a graph combining the effectiveness of the government's water access policy (effective policy = low mortality rate + good access of residents to drinking water services) as well as political stability (indeed, difficult to consult with an administration if the political situation is unstable)


### II - Technical details to be observed üîç

<br/> 1- Exclude countries whose political instability is too strong, the dashboard must include a filter (modifiable by the user) to exclude countries that are too unstable
<br/> 2- For indicators combining 2 variables, a scatter plot must be displayed
<br/> 3- It is important to see the evolution of certain indicators over time
<br/> 4- The "Blue" palette, consistent with the color of the water, must be used
<br/> 5- At least 3 views are delivered
<br/> 6- The sheets must have a different scope and include consistency in the data they present
<br/> 7- Each of these graphs is used at least once:
<br/> ‚Ä¢ Lineplot
<br/> ‚Ä¢ Scatter plot
<br/> ‚Ä¢ Grouped Barplot
<br/> ‚Ä¢ Stacked Barplot or Percent Stacked Barplot
<br/> 8- At least 4 filters are used on the variables :
<br/> ‚Ä¢ One for one quantitative variable
<br/> ‚Ä¢ One for a qualitative variable
<br/> ‚Ä¢ One for time data
<br/> ‚Ä¢ One for geographic data
<br/> 9- At least one merge has been performed on the files
