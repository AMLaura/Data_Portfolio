# Project 8 : Carry out a market research ✈️
## Language : Python 💻
## Project duration : 120H ⌛
#### You can find my notebook in the folder

### I- The main objective 🎯

A French food company wanted to expand internationally: no particular country or continent is currently chosen. All countries are possible.

I had a large flexibility concerning the data on the FAO site.

### II- To do so 
<br/> - I realized a hierarchical ascending classification, with a dendrogram visualization
<br/> - I used the k-means method, in order to refine the analysis and compare the results of the two clustering methods (+ analyze the centroids of your classes)
<br/> - I carried out a PCA in order to visualize the results of the analysis, to understand the groups, the links between the variables, the links between the individuals...
<br/> - I made a heatmap with the intersections between the country clusters and the different variables

### III- Key points ⚠️
- I have taken into account the countries under embargo
- I have taken vegetarian countries into account
- I also took into account that the meat must obtain certification before being distributed
