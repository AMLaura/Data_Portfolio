# Project 5 : Analyze the sales of a bookstore ðŸ“š
## Language : Python ðŸ’»
## Project duration : 100H âŒ›
#### You can find my notebook and the presentation I prepared (initially in PPT format)

### I- The main objective ðŸŽ¯

<br/> Lapage was originally a physical bookstore with several points of sale. But given the success of some of its products and the enthusiasm of its customers, 
it decided two years ago to open an online sales site.

The company wanted to take stock after 2 years of operation and be able to analyze its strengths, weaknesses, customer behavior, etc.

My main missions involve analyzing : 
<br/> 1- The evolution over time and the implementation of a moving average breakdown to assess the overall trend
<br/> 2- Distribution of turnover between customers via a Lorenz curve
<br/> 3- Concerning the turnover: the distribution by category, gender or even year
<br/> 4- Tops and flops (reference)
<br/> 5- The link between the gender of a customer and the categories of books purchased
<br/> 6- The link between the age of customer and the total amount of purchases
<br/> 7- The link between age and purchase frequency
<br/> 8- The link between age and the size of the average shopping cart
<br/> 9- The link between the age and the categories of books purchased


### II- The databases provided are as follows

For this, I had at my disposal 3 databases:
<br/> 1- "customers" (customer ID, date of birth and gender of the customer)
<br/> 2- "produtcs" (product identifier, price of the book and the category to which the book belongs)
<br/> 3- "transactions" (customer ID, product ID, session ID and date)

### III- Duties ðŸ“ˆ

<br/> 1- Clean databases
<br/> 2- Perform joins
<br/> 3- Perform queries
<br/> 4- Perform statistical tests (CHI2 test, Spearman test, Kruskall-Wallis test)
